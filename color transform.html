 the first naval fleet, consisting of six small patrol vessels, was inaugurated. 
 The navy carried out around 45 operations during the war.In 2009, the Bangladesh
 government adopted a long-term modernisation plan for its armed forces called Forces Goal 2030.

 The Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) is the aerial warfare branch of the Bangladesh Armed Forces.
 The Air Force is primarily responsible for air defence of Bangladesh's sovereign territory
 as well as providing air support to the Bangladesh Army and Bangladesh Navy. Furthermore,
 the BAF has a territorial role in providing tactical and strategic air transport and logistics capability 
 for the country. The Bangladesh Air Force was officially formed on 28 September 1971 consisting of 
 the revolting Bengali officers and airmen of the Pakistan Air Force at Dimapur of Nagaland, India and
 it was launched formally by flying three repaired vintage aircraft on 8 October 1971.
 After independence, in November–December 1972 the BAF received a significant donation from the former USSR.
 Among the aircraft delivered were ten single-seat Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21MFs, two twin-seat
 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21UMs, and twelve Mil Mi-8 utility helicopters. Later China also supplied some
 equipment.The Bangladesh Air Force has an ambitious modernisation plan to be implemented in upcoming 
 years under Forces Goal 2030. As per the goal, air force is to be a strong deterrent force to well 
 protect the sky of Bangladesh. Plans are made to strengthen both air power and land based air defence 
 capabilities. Since the formulation of the forces goal 2030, the BAF has developed in many folds.
 The Air Force has set up an advanced training unit named 105 Advance Jet Training Unit which is a 
 dedicated fighter pilot training unit of BAF. The unit consists of three training squadrons which
 will provide advanced training to the pilots selected for operating the fighter jets.
 Since 2010, BAF has taken the delivery of sixteen Chengdu F-7BGI fighter aircraft,
 sixteen Yakovlev Yak-130 advanced jet trainers, two C-130J transport aircraft, 
 nine K-8W jet trainer aircraft, three Let L-410 Turbolet transport trainer aircraft 
 and twenty three PT-6 basic trainers. Process is going on for the procurement of 
 sixteen multirole combat aircraft.

 forces are going through a long term modernization plan named Forces Goal 2030. Bangladesh army is 
 under a massive expansion and modernization drive as per the plan. The force is being divided into three 
 corps — Central, Eastern and Western. Three new infantry divisions have been raised, the 17th infantry
 division at Sylhet.The Bangladesh Army has been actively involved in a number of United Nations Peace 
 Support Operations (UNPSO) since its formation in the 1970s. Its first deployments came in 1988, when
 it participated in two operations – UNIIMOG in Iraq and UNTAG in Namibia President HM Ershad initiated
